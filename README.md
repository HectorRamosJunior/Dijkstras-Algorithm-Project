# Shortest Path Project
2014 C++ Solution to Computer Project 2 in Discrete Mathematics.
Involves a detailed graph with undirected edges with values for tolls, distance, and danger.
The project involved using Dijkstra's Algorithm to solve for the shortest path between two nodes in terms of price, distance, or danger. 

Was working alone, but made headway despite serious time constraints -- wasn't able to do the Traveling Salesman part of it unfortunately.
